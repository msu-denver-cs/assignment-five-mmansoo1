Finishing assignment 5 proved to be a little challenging for me at first. This was the first time I worked with JavaScript, so figuring out how HTML and Javascript worked together was my first task. Looking at the example SPAs helped a lot in guiding me to my finished product. I had to understand how exactly functions can be called in HTML, how to pass in parameters correctly (especially since some of them were arrays), and how requests work and which methods are associated with them. 

I was largely unaware the the application had saved data in a JSON file, so once I realized I had to display that JSON information made the assignment speed up. The trickiest part was actually displaying the data in a for loop. I first implemented the example's for loop to see how it all worked together, however I needed a way to make it simpler and easier for myself to understand. This led me to figuring out the Javascript can be used to refer to certain HTML elements and Id's, and created HTML elements for them. I ended up putting all the data in a list and displaying it, which was a fairly straightforward task and also something that made sense to me codewise.
